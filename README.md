# Accessible PDF Maker
## Weekly Status
### Week of 09/26/2020 - 10/02/2020
**Things Done:**
- Had the first meeting with the sponsor.
  - Obtained some info about current process to make accessible PDF :
    - https://chi2021.acm.org/for-authors/presenting/papers/guide-to-an-accessible-submission
    - https://assets19.sigaccess.org/creating_accessible_pdfs.html
    - https://webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/converting
    - https://github.com/petergramaglia/access_sigchi
  - Expected priority of development:
    1. Less manual work on generating accessible PDFs
    2. Avoid Adobe Acrobat Pro to reduce accessibility cost for users
    3. Batch processing capability
- Some research about PDF format:

- Engineering Diagram

- User Consideration
  1. Deliverable goals are listed in "Expected priority of development" section above.
  2. The app should protect user’s data and privacy. If the app is stealing the user's PDF when they upload it, that user will not want to use the app. Because of this, this project will not use a database for our web application, and no information about a user will be stored in any way.
  3. The app itself should be fully accessible. While this should be true of all products, since this project is specifically for adding accessibility, it would be diappointing if itself fails to meet common accessibility requirements.
  

**Things Planned:**
1. Will have the second meeting with the sponsor next Friday.
2. Research more on existing libraries/packages that could help decoding/making PDF files with accessible elements. If certain language/framework has some powerful packages already, this project will incline to use that in order to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
3. Think about tech stack.

### Week of 10/03/2020 - 10/09/2020
**Things Done:**
- Finally got into CS Slack. -_-#
- Did more research about PDF format:
  - https://web.archive.org/web/20141010035745/http://gnupdf.org/Introduction_to_PDF#General_structure
- Found a promising npm packages on PDF:
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdfkit
  
** Difficulties and Failures:**
- Team wasn't productive in this week. Communication wasn't smooth as members are having their midterms.
- Meeting with the sponsor was cancelled but rescheduling hasn't been done since she was on vacation.
- Team weighing on tech stacks. Web frameworks seem easy to pick up and use but Python seems good, too. During the summer, Code for Good had already made a Ruby on Rails app that provides a web interface for this project. Although there wasn't mcuh achinevement on the PDF side, we could still continue from there.  

**Things Planned:**
1. Planned meeting with the sponsor was postponed. Will have the meeting this week.
2. Research more on existing libraries/packages that could help decoding/making PDF files with accessible elements.
3. Need to discuss whether to make a web app (so we can use the existing npm packages which seems to be pretty helpful) or start with a local app programmed in C/C++/Python.


### Week of 10/10/2020 - 10/16/2020
**Things Done:**
- Had the second meeting with Dr. Short. Scheduled next meeting on two weeks from today.
- Read some articles that contain helpful informations on the PDF accessibiltiy topic:
  - https://www.pdfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/PDFUA-in-a-Nutshell-PDFUA.pdf
  - https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/creating-accessible-pdfs.html#:~:text=%20Workflow%20for%20creating%20accessible%20PDFs%20%201,In%20Acrobat%20Pro%2C%20this%20stage%20includes...%20More%20
- Found more libraries on PDF:
  - https://www.pdflib.com/
  - https://pdf-lib.js.org/docs/api/index#const-beginmarkedcontent (JavaScript)
  - https://hexapdf.gettalong.org/ (Ruby)
  - https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/ (Python)
  
** Difficulties and Failures:**
- Found this post when looking for some libraries to tag PDFs (for accessibility labels): https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/579/how-can-tagged-pdfs-be-created-that-support-universal-accessibility-and-reflowin. It seems that many people tried the same thing but eventually gave up. Their previous work is disconitnued. 

**Things Planned:**
1. Try those different libraries found to see if any of them is helpful. 
2. Get the Ruby on Rail project from Tufts Code for Good up and running to see if there is anything we can build up upon.
3. Begin research on if LaTeX source files will be needed in order to make an accessible PDF, and how to parse LaTeX if needed

### Week of 10/17/2020 - 10/23/2020
**Things Done:**
- Investigated the different PDF libraries. We believe pdflib will suit our needs and are getting close to committing to a tech stack based on these findings
- Did some preliminary research on the usefulness of LaTeX files in tagging a PDF. Short answer, we will probably need to use LaTeX source code to some degree. We might even be able to design a small LaTeX package to allow inserting tags and alt text in LaTeX
  - http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb30-2/tb95moore.pdf
- Assessed our risks and created a chart outlining the most prominent risks associated with our project.
  
** Difficulties and Failures:**
- As with last week, it seems that people have tried to do what we need to do, with limited success. No industry-standard tool for creating tagged PDFs exists. Many failed or deprecated projects have been found in our research.
- It is time-consuming to set up an environment to test a PDF library, and to write enough code to be satisfied with the functionality of the library. We did not test each library equally because of these issues, and it's possible we will use a library that isn't the best of our options.

**Things Planned:**
- Work on a project to show competency for the upcoming assignment. Create a presentation based on this display of competency.
- Continue to research LaTeX source code and the possibility of user-provided metadata and alt text within the LaTeX source code.

### Week of 10/24/2020 - 10/30/2020
**Things Done:**
- Met with Dr. Short and discussed the possibility of creating tagged PDFs by converting LaTeX -> HTML -> tagged PDF, since HTML is already in a tagged format.
- Found the 'prince' software (https://www.princexml.com/), which can convert HTML to a tagged PDF. The free version puts a watermark on the resulting PDF, but this can be avoided by buying a license for the software
  
** Difficulties and Failures:**
- None of the libraries found have an API for adding tags to a PDF. These libraries are useful if we know what objects are needed to create a tag in the PDF format, but do not offer this themselves.
- There just aren't enough resources about how to tag a PDF online. It seems to require significant expertise in the PDF format to get creating tagged PDFs correct.
- Dr. Short does not love our LaTeX -> HTML -> tagged PDF plan, since it has inconsistent effects on formatting. She has encouraged us to continue researching how to add tags to a PDF without using HTML

**Things Planned:**
- Reach out to the prince development team to ask for support. If prince has developed a method for creating a tagged PDF, they might be willing to share their knowledge of creating tagged PDFs to aide our work.
- Touch base with Ming on if he knows any alumni who have done work on PDFs or are currently working on PDFs.
- Complete New Competency Proficiency Demo
